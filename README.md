# KakuOCR
 (Needs a better name) A little project that lets you write with your finger (and maybe ocr later)

## Overview

"Planned things"

- ~~Better writing experience (less lag, less jittery)~~
- ~~Should be able to get the writing and display it in the top left or something rather than just the canvas~~
- ~~OCR (I want to 'train' our own model) (We can use the  J-HOCR, JAIST, Kondate, ETL datasets)~~
- Need to get the actual prediction correct
